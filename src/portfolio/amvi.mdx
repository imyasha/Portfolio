AMVI, Amamos Vivir Cada Día A.C. is a Mexican non-profit organisation helping
children with degenerative illnesses by fulfiling their dreams and helping
their families financially, but also with personal support. During the
Covid-19 crisis, their donations have plummeted since they did not have a
website, so I decided to help by building this site for them using Gatsby,
TypeScript and Styled-Components, proudly hosted on Netlify who helped the
cause with a free pro plan.
