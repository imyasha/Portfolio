Raconteur is a publishing company and content marketing agency based in
London and mostly known for their special reports in The Times and The
Sunday Times. I developed their Agency website with a cutting-edge
technology stack, which led to a 30% lower bounce rate and 50% higher
engagement ratings. The technology used is WordPress as a headless CMS
with GatsbyJS as a front end and GraphQL for the data layer.
